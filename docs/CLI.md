---

# Interactive Mode Details

### Example

```
> define x = 10
> sldeploy x
> :run
```

After running:

* Code is executed
* You are prompted to save the file

---

## Save Prompt

After execution:

```
Do you want to save this code? (y/n):
```

If `y`:

1. Enter folder path
2. Enter file name
3. File will be saved as `.sl`

---

# File Type Handling

## .sl files

* Parsed and executed by:

  * Lexer
  * Parser
  * Evaluator

## .md files

* Rendered to HTML
* Opened in browser

## Other extensions

```
Incorrect file extension. Create .sl or .md to be able to run correctly.
```

* Program exits safely
